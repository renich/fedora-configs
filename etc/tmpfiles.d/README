Thin
====

You need to create a thin user or a myapp user.

The thin user will run your ruby app. It will write the sock file to /run/thin.

The convention to follow for the sock name is: <hostname>.sock. 
For example: www.myapp.com.sock

You can include a redirect in your nginx app to guarantee that the user accesses www.myapp.com all the time.
